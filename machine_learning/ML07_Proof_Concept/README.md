# ML07_Proof_Concept  
  

## Project 7 of Machine Learning Engineer cursus : Develop a proof of concept
  
### Object  
  
Choose a paper on the subject of your choice with the objective to try to improve the results of a previous project.  
I have choosen to keep on working on image classification using deep learning with the implementation of the paper Learning What and Where To Transfer. I was limited by my computing ressources and was not able to reproduce the results of the study. I made some observations that let me doubt of the ability to use this approach on diversified networks and tasks.  
  
  
### Data  

Same as in ML06  
  
  
### Files  of the repo
    
The folder whatwhere includes all the work done around the paper, including all code refactoring and the report (in French).  
  
Addition of another work on image classification (out of the OpenClassrooms / CentraleSup√©lec cursus) :  
As I couldn't improve my results by applying the paper Learning What and Where to Transfer, I decided to try to add an object detection in order to crop the image on the dog prior to the classification.  
Notebooks related to this addition are MML07bis_02_CreateCropImagesFolders.ipynb and ML07bis_03_EfficientNetB4_CropImages.ipynb  
The latter one also includes an analysis of accuracy by dog race.
