# ML08_Predict_Future_Sales
  
## Project 8 of Machine Learning Engineer cursus : Enter a Kaggle competition
  
### Mission : Predict Future Sales
  
I choose the competition "Predict Future Sales" for several reasons :  
- predicting future sales is a recurrent task in business ;  
- it deals with time series. I didn't have a chance to work on time series during this cursus ;  
- I want to apply machine learning techniques to time series, other than the SARIMA approach I had the opportunity to explore during my Data Analyst cursus.  
  
  
### Data  
  
See Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales  
  
  
### Files of the repo  
  
ML_08_00_Get_Data_From_Kaggle.ipynb and ML_08_01_Translating_From_Russian.ipynb were run on Google Colab to import data from Kaggle and translate the data in English, in order to better understand data.  
data holds all the data files, in Russian and in English, as well as the files that served the translation.  
  
The notebook an-economic-oriented-feature-engineering.ipynb is the download of a Kaggle kernel. It is about data exploration, cleaning, analysis and feature engineering with an economic bias. It is also publicly available at Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/sylvainfriot/an-economic-oriented-feature-engineering  
The notebook predict-future-sales-features-distribution.ipynb is the next step : analysis of the distribution of the created features. It is also publicly available at Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/sylvainfriot/predict-future-sales-features-distribution  
Those two notebooks were run on Kaggle.  
  
I did a few preliminary submissions. But I want to go further. So I am still working on this project and I will release my work when I am done with it. Stay tuned !
